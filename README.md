# expense-tracker-2023
 my take on an full stack expense tracker application using reactjs, nodejs, and mysql 
 
 the frontend user interface is created using react, that interacts with a mysql database using nodejs, a server side rendering
 
 the database sits locally on my machine so im not too sure how to distribute it
